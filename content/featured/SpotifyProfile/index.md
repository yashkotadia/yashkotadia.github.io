Due to lack of coordination among various organisations trying to help refugees, be it in their country of origin or the country they flee to, resources are not utilised efficiently and there are loopholes which may be exploited by malicious individuals, further worsening the crisis.

OneWorld tries to plug these loopholes and centralise the efforts of the organisations, hence improving the efficiency of the rescue operations, resource remittance and diplomatic activities.
